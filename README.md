## Installation Requirements (Who needs to install what?)

This platform is a **web-based application**. 
- **End-Users (Employees doing training)**: **NOTHING**. They only need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and the internal company URL.
- **Developers (Me)**: Docker Desktop, Python, Node.js, Git.
- **Production Server (IT/DevOps)**: Docker Engine, Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, and Ollama (AI).

## How End-Users Access the Platform
1. The platform is deployed to a central company server.
2. Employees receive an internal link (e.g., `https://training.company.local`).
3. They log in with their company credentials.
4. They complete the training entirely in their browser.
5. **They do not download, clone, or install any code or tools on their personal machines.**
